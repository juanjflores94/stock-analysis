## Summary

### Pros and Cons of Refactoring Code

Refactoring code makes it much cleaner and organized for others to read. It's much more beneficial for others to read code that is simpler and straight forward instead of making the code more complex. Other advantages include saved time and money in the future and efficiency. On the other side of the spectrum refactored code is often hard for others to recognize and the benefit is not always evident. You will also have to test the functions again to make sure they work.
